# Welcome to the freecam configuration file.
# Advice: Do not use the middle mouse button for FREECAM, the game uses middle mouse button for zooming to units and that key is not rebindable sadly.
#		  VK_XBUTTON1 Also suffers from a similar issue.
# VK key codes can be found at - https://cherrytree.at/misc/vk.htm, Otherwise look up a VK_keycode map/list for your language.
# It is not neccesary but it is highly reccommended that the controls below match the controls ingame.
# Binds can either be a VK keycode or simply the character you desire.

									# Other settings such as camera speed, smoothening and such do not scale with this value, you will need to tweak
